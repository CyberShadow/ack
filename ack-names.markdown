# What do we call the new general purpose ack?

Ack is too surprising to non-programmers.  There will be a less
surprising, more greplike tool that takes goodness from ack.  But
what do we call it?

Must be

* pronouncable
    * and monosyllabic
* easy to type
* three characters
    * four maaaaybe if it's super easy to type, say, like "akjf"
* relatively low Googling conflict
    * not already a word
* No conflict with existing BSD ports, Ubuntu packages or Fedora RPMs

The source code for ack is now at github: http://github.com/petdance/ack

[FIXES]
The --pager flag would not work.  Now it does.  Thanks Packy Anderson.


[ENHANCEMENTS]
Added Scala support.  Thanks to Dan Sully.

Added .phtml as an extension for PHP.

Using -f or -g now return a proper error code.  If files are found,
ack returns 0.  If none are found, ack returns 1.  This is a change
in the specification, but the code didn't match the specfication
anyway.


1.90        Mon Sep  7 23:24:24 CDT 2009
[ENHANCEMENTS]
Added Ada support.  Thanks to Shaun Patterson.

Added -r, -R and --recurse options as in grep.  They have no
effect because directory recursion is on by default.  Also added
--no-recurse for orthoganality. Thanks to Mark Stosberg and
Ryan Niebur.

Version in --version is prettier.  Thanks, Ori Avtalion.

Added an updated ack.bash_completion.sh from Adam James.

[FIXES]
Expanded --files-without-match to --files-without-matches.

Removed all the hi-bit characters, so we don't have any encoding
problems.  It's all entities now.

Fixed capture-stderr to localize some globals that were obscuring
errors.  Thanks very much to Christopher Madsen.

Fixed uninitialized errors in tickets #138 and #159.

[DOCUMENTATION]
Fixed an incorrect command line in the docs for -f.

Added notes on --pager.  Thanks to Mike Morearty.

[BUILD]
Made the squash program more robust when handling POD.  Thanks
to Kent Fredric.


1.89_02     Wed May 13 16:20:21 CDT 2009
[DISTRIBUTION]
Updated Makefile.PL to use new ExtUtils::MakeMaker features.
Thanks, Schwern.

[FEATURES]
--version now shows the version of Perl that ack is running
under, and the full path to the Perl executable.

Added new switches --color-match and --color-filename, which
let you define ACK_COLOR_MATCH and ACK_COLOR_FILENAME from the
command line.

Added new switch --column to display the column of the first
hit on the row.  Thanks to Eric Van Dewoestine.

Added .ss to --scheme.

[FIXES]
No longer die if you have a .tar.gz file in your tree.

More tweaks to get the detection of input and output pipes
working.

Fixed an amazingly bad call to cmp_ok() in t/ack-passthru.t.

[DOCUMENTATION]
Started an ack FAQ.
